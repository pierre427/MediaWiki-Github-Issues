Github Issues MediaWiki Extension
=================================

Adds a tag to render a list of Github issues inline.

Usage
-----

```html
<githubissues src="https://github.com/aaronpk/p3k/issues"/>
```

The base URL must be of the format `https://github.com/{user}/{repo}/issues`.

When the page is rendered, a table containing all referenced issues will
be rendered in place of the tag.
